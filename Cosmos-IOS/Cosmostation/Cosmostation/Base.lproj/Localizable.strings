However, Go-Ethereum remained a very monolithic tech stack difficult to hard-fork from. That is where Tendermint came in.\n\nThe goal of Tendermint is to provide the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain as a generic engine on which arbitrary applications can be built. With Tendermint, developers can save hundreds of hours of development work.";

This is a very important feat, as it gives maximum flexibility to each blockchain.\n\nThe principle behind IBC is fairly simple. Let’s take an example where an account on chain A wants to send 10 tokens X on chain B. First, these tokens are locked on chain A. Then, a proof that these 10 tokens X are locked is relayed from chain A to chain B. Chain B tracks the validator set of chain A. If the proof is signed by more than 2/3rd of chain A’s validators, then it is valid, and 10 tokens X are created on chain B.";
